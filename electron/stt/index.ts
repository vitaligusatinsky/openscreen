/**
 * Owner of the long-lived STT pipeline. One instance per Electron app.
 *
 * Workflow:
 *   1. `init()` spawns `whisper-stt-server` (or queues the call if it's busy).
 *   2. `transcribe()` splits the renderer's `Float32Array` into chunks
 *      (`chunking.ts`) and runs each through whisper-stt-server's HTTP
 *      `/inference`, which returns both phrase- and word-level segments in one
 *      pass (see whisperServer.ts). Word timestamps come from whisper.cpp's
 *      native DTW token timestamps (`t_dtw`, LARGE_V3_TURBO aheads preset,
 *      `flash_attn = false`), see
 *      technical-documentation/architecture/transcription-and-captions.md § Decision rationale.
 *   3. `shutdown()` tears down on app quit.
 *
 * Status events fan out to every attached sink so the renderer can drive its
 * "loading model" / "transcribing" indicator.
 *
 * Why chunked rather than one request: a 30-minute recording took ~10 minutes
 * in a single `/inference` call — no progress to show, no way to recover from a
 * transient failure without redoing everything, and long enough that the HTTP
 * client's own header timeout killed it before whisper ever answered. Chunks
 * turn that into a progress signal, a retry unit, and — via `cancel()` — the
 * only point where a run in flight can be stopped at all.
 *
 * Chunks run SEQUENTIALLY, and that is a measured choice, not an omission:
 * whisper-stt-server holds a single model context, so concurrent `/inference`
 * calls don't just serialize — they get SLOWER. Two 120s chunks took 76.9s one
 * after the other and 144.1s fired together (0.53x, i.e. ~1.9x slower) on this
 * Vulkan backend. A client-side worker pool is therefore a pessimisation. Real
 * parallelism would need several server processes, each with its own copy of
 * the model resident on the GPU; that trade (VRAM + spawn cost per worker) is
 * worth revisiting only if a much smaller model ever becomes the default.
