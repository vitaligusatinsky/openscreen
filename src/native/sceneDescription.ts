/**
 * Scene contract — the flat description the app hands the native D3D compositor so it can
 * compute the composed frame itself (preview AND export) with **no POC-fixture logic**.
 *
 * Division of labour:
 *  - App (TS, this file): *serialize* the document + editor settings into this flat shape.
 *    Pure data mapping, no per-frame math.
 *  - Native (Rust, separate): owns the per-frame math (layout geometry, zoom easing, effect
 *    application) — it reads this description + the current time and composes.
 *
 * This replaces the hardcoded fixture `timeline()` (A↔B layout animation + 6s zoom schedule)
 * that used to drive the compositor.
 *
 * NOTE (worker): implement `buildSceneDescription` below. Everything else here is the frozen
 * contract — do not change the exported types.

	 *
	 * So the layout has to be resolved per clip. Resolving it once for the whole scene
	 * was already wrong for a document mixing recording resolutions — the crop only
	 * made the existing defect visible, by letting one document hold two shapes.
