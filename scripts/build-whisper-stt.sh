# macOS: make the staged tree relocatable.
#
# CMake links the helper and every ggml/whisper dylib against `@rpath/...` and
# then bakes a single absolute LC_RPATH pointing at its own build tree
# (`.cache/whisper-stt-build/build-<tag>-<variant>/bin`). That resolves on the
# machine that ran the build and nowhere else: delete the build cache, or
# download the CI artifact onto a different runner, and dyld cannot find
# libwhisper at all — the process aborts (SIGABRT, exit 134) before main().
#
# This is the macOS twin of the Windows 0xC0000135 incident that shipped in
# 1.8.0-rc.1..rc.3 (see the OpenSSL note in the CMakeLists). Swapping the
# absolute rpath for `@loader_path` makes each binary look for its siblings
# next to itself, which is exactly how the staged directory and the packaged
# `resources/electron/native/bin/<tag>/` are laid out.
#
# Editing a Mach-O header invalidates its code signature, and arm64 refuses to
# execute an unsigned-but-modified image ("killed: 9"), so each patched file is
# re-signed ad-hoc afterwards.
